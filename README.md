# sudoku-solver-gui-python
A python Sudoku solver with pygame GUI

How To Use:
 - Make sure you have pygame installed. Run the sudokugui_simplified.py file (make sure it can access the Sudoku_simplified.py file). Click a box to select it. Type a number in the box to enter it into the board. If a number is not valid for a spot, you will not be able to enter it. Type 0 in a cell to clear that cell. Press the delete key to clear the board. When ready, press the solve button to solve the board.
 
Background:
 - It uses the same backtracking algorithm from the 'sudoku-solver-cpp' project, but is written in python and has a pygame GUI.
 
What I Learned:
 - By completing this project, I learned more about pygame and the implementation of classes in python. To learn how to create a grid and interact with it in pygame, I referenced a pygame GUI tutorial from a 'Tech With Tim' blog post with a similar sudoku project.
